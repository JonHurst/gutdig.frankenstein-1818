evening, the young girl and her companion
were employed in various occupations
which I did not understand; and the
old man again took up the instrument,
which produced the divine sounds that
had enchanted me in the morning. So
soon as he had finished, the youth
began, not to play, but to utter sounds
that were monotonous, and neither resembling
the harmony of the old man’s
instrument or the songs of the birds; I
since found that he read aloud, but at
that time I knew nothing of the science
of words or letters.

“The family, after having been thus
occupied for a short time, extinguished
their lights, and retired, as I conjectured,
to rest.”
