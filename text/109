the cause of my visit. The ballots had
been thrown; they were all black, and
Justine was condemned.

I cannot pretend to describe what I
then felt. I had before experienced
sensations of horror; and I have endeavoured
to bestow upon them adequate
expressions, but words cannot convey
an idea of the heart-sickening despair
that I then endured. The person to
whom I addressed myself added, that
Justine had already confessed her guilt.
“That evidence,” he observed, “was
hardly required in so glaring a case,
but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none
of our judges like to condemn a criminal
upon circumstantial evidence, be
it ever so decisive.”

When I returned home, Elizabeth
eagerly demanded the result.

“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided
as you may have expected; all
judges had rather that ten innocent
should suffer, than that one guilty should
escape. But she has confessed.”

This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth,
who had relied with firmness upon
Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said
she, “how shall I ever again believe in
human benevolence? Justine, whom I
loved and esteemed as my sister, how
could she put on those smiles of innocence
only to betray; her mild eyes
seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour,
and yet she has committed a
murder.”

Soon after we heard that the poor
victim had expressed a wish to see my
cousin. My father wished her not to
go; but said, that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to decide.
