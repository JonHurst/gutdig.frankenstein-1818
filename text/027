As he said this, his countenance became
expressive of a calm settled grief,
that touched me to the heart. But
he was silent, and presently retired to
his cabin.

Even broken in spirit as he is, no
one can feel more deeply than he does

from earth. Such a man has a double
existence: he may suffer misery, and
be overwhelmed by disappointments;
yet when he has retired into himself, he
will be like a celestial spirit, that has
a halo around him, within whose circle
no grief or folly ventures.

Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I
express concerning this divine wanderer?
If you do, you must have certainly
lost that simplicity which was
once your characteristic charm. Yet,
if you will, smile at the warmth of my
expressions, while I find every day new
causes for repeating them.
