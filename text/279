whom I have turned loose upon society,
still exists. You refuse my just
demand: I have but one resource; and
I devote myself, either in my life or

I trembled with excess of agitation
as I said this; there was a phrenzy in
my manner, and something, I doubt
not, of that haughty fierceness, which
the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.
But to a Genevan magistrate,
whose mind was occupied by far other
ideas than those of devotion and
heroism, this elevation of mind had
much the appearance of madness. He
endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse
does a child, and reverted to my tale
as the effects of delirium.

“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant
art thou in thy pride of wisdom!
Cease; you know not what it is you
say.”

I broke from the house angry and
disturbed, and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.
