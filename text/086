country I had so long inhabited. I acceded
with pleasure to this proposition:
I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had
always been my favourite companion in
the rambles of this nature that I had
taken among the scenes of my native
country.

We passed a fortnight in these perambulations:
my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained
additional strength from the salubrious
air I breathed, the natural incidents of
our progress, and the conversation of
my friend. Study had before secluded
me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures,
and rendered me unsocial;
but Clerval called forth the better feelings
of my heart; he again taught me
to love the aspect of nature, and the
cheerful faces of children. Excellent
friend! how sincerely did you love me,
and endeavour to elevate my mind,
until it was on a level with your own.
A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed
me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses;
I became the same happy creature who,
a few years ago, loving and beloved by
all, had no sorrow or care. When
happy, inanimate nature had the power
of bestowing on me the most delightful
sensations. A serene sky and verdant
fields filled me with ecstacy. The
present season was indeed divine; the
flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges,
while those of summer were already in
bud: I was undisturbed by thoughts
which during the preceding year had
pressed upon me, notwithstanding my
endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden.
