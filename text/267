still reside within the walls, for the
benefit of Ernest, that he might follow
his studies at the schools.

In the mean time I took every
precaution to defend my person, in case
the fiend should openly attack me. I
carried pistols and a dagger constantly
about me, and was ever on the watch
to prevent artifice; and by these means
gained a greater degree of tranquillity.
Indeed, as the period approached, the
threat appeared more as a delusion, not
to be regarded as worthy to disturb my
peace, while the happiness I hoped for
in my marriage wore a greater appearance
of certainty, as the day fixed for
its solemnization drew nearer, and I
heard it continually spoken of as an
occurrence which no accident could
possibly prevent.

Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil
demeanour contributed greatly
to calm her mind. But on the day
that was to fulfil my wishes and
my destiny, she was melancholy, and
a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of the
dreadful secret, which I had promised
to reveal to her the following day. My
father was in the mean time overjoyed,
and, in the bustle of preparation, only
observed in the melancholy of his niece
the diffidence of a bride.

After the ceremony was performed,
a large party assembled at my fatherâ€™s;
but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I
should pass the afternoon and night at
Evian, and return to Cologny the next
morning. As the day was fair, and the
wind favourable, we resolved to go by
water.
