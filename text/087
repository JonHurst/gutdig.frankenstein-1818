Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and
sincerely sympathized in my feelings:
he exerted himself to amuse me, while
he expressed the sensations that filled
his soul. The resources of his mind
on this occasion were truly astonishing:
his conversation was full of imagination;
and very often, in imitation
of the Persian and Arabic writers, he
invented tales of wonderful fancy and
passion. At other times he repeated
my favourite poems, or drew me out
into arguments, which he supported
with great ingenuity.

We returned to our college on a
Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared
gay and happy. My own spirits
were high, and I bounded along
with feelings of unbridled joy and
hilarity.
