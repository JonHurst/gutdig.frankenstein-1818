CHAPTER VII.

My present situation was one in
which all voluntary thought was swallowed
up and lost. I was hurried
away by fury; revenge alone endowed
me with strength and composure; it
modelled my feelings, and allowed me
to be calculating and calm, at periods
when otherwise delirium or death
would have been my portion.

My first resolution was to quit
Geneva for ever; my country, which,
when I was happy and beloved, was
dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
hateful. I provided myself with
a sum of money, together with a few
jewels which had belonged to my
mother, and departed.

And now my wanderings began,
which are to cease but with life. I
have traversed a vast portion of the
earth, and have endured all the hardships
which travellers, in deserts and
barbarous countries, are wont to meet.
How I have lived I hardly know; many
times have I stretched my failing limbs
upon the sandy plain, and prayed for
death. But revenge kept me alive; I
dared not die, and leave my adversary
in being.

When I quitted Geneva, my first
labour was to gain some clue by which
I might trace the steps of my fiendish
