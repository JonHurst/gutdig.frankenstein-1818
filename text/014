approve or amend my plans. How would
such a friend repair the faults of your
poor brother! I am too ardent in execution,
and too impatient of difficulties.
But it is a still greater evil to me
that I am self-educated: for the first
fourteen years of my life I ran wild on
a common, and read nothing but our
uncle Thomasâ€™s books of voyages. At
that age I became acquainted with the
celebrated poets of our own country;
but it was only when it had ceased to be
in my power to derive its most important
benefits from such a conviction, that I
perceived the necessity of becoming
acquainted with more languages than
that of my native country. Now I am
twenty-eight, and am in reality more
illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen.
It is true that I have thought
more, and that my day dreams are
more extended and magnificent; but
they want (as the painters call it)
{{keeping}}; and I greatly need a friend
who would have sense enough not to
despise me as romantic, and affection
enough for me to endeavour to regulate
my mind.

Well, these are useless complaints; I
shall certainly find no friend on the
wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel,
among merchants and seamen. Yet
some feelings, unallied to the dross of
human nature, beat even in these rugged
bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance,
is a man of wonderful courage
and enterprise; he is madly desirous of
glory. He is an Englishman, and in
the midst of national and professional
prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation,
retains some of the noblest endowments
