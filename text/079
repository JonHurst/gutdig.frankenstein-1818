few words. Madame Moritz, her mother,
was a widow with four children,
of whom Justine was the third. This
girl had always been the favourite of
her father; but, through a strange perversity,
her mother could not endure
her, and, after the death of M. Moritz,
treated her very ill. My aunt observed
this; and, when Justine was twelve
years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at her house. The
republican institutions of our country
have produced simpler and happier
manners than those which prevail in
the great monarchies that surround it.
Hence there is less distinction between
the several classes of its inhabitants;
and the lower orders being neither so

are more refined and moral. A servant
in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England.
Justine, thus received in our family,
learned the duties of a servant; a
condition which, in our fortunate country,
does not include the idea of ignorance,
and a sacrifice of the dignity of
a human being.

you well remember the heroine of my

that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty
of Angelica – she looked so frank-hearted
and happy. My aunt conceived a great
attachment for her, by which she was
