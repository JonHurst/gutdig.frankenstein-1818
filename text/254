Elizabeth, and Ernest; but these words
only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes,
indeed, I felt a wish for happiness;
and thought, with melancholy delight,
of my beloved cousin; or longed,
with a devouring {{maladie du pays}}, to
see once more the blue lake and rapid
Rhone, that had been so dear to me in
early childhood: but my general state
of feeling was a torpor, in which a
prison was as welcome a residence as
the divinest scene in nature; and these
fits were seldom interrupted, but by
paroxysms of anguish and despair. At
these moments I often endeavoured to
put an end to the existence I loathed;
and it required unceasing attendance
and vigilance to restrain me from
committing some dreadful act of
violence.

I remember, as I quitted the prison,
I heard one of the men say, “He may
be innocent of the murder, but he has
certainly a bad conscience.” These
words struck me. A bad conscience!
yes, surely I had one. William, Justine,
and Clerval, had died through
my infernal machinations; “And whose
death,” cried I, “is to finish the tragedy?
Ah! my father, do not remain
in this wretched country; take me
where I may forget myself, my existence,
and all the world.”

My father easily acceded to my desire;
and, after having taken leave of
Mr. Kirwin, we hastened to Dublin. I
felt as if I was relieved from a heavy
weight, when the packet sailed with a
fair wind from Ireland, and I had
quitted for ever the country which had
been to me the scene of so much
misery.
