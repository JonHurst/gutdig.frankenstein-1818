meet with beings, who, pardoning my
outward form, would love me for the
excellent qualities which I was capable
of bringing forth. I was nourished
with high thoughts of honour and devotion.
But now vice has degraded
me beneath the meanest animal. No
crime, no mischief, no malignity, no
misery, can be found comparable to
mine. When I call over the frightful
catalogue of my deeds, I cannot believe
that I am he whose thoughts were
once filled with sublime and transcendant
visions of the beauty and the majesty
of goodness. But it is even so;
the fallen angel becomes a malignant
devil. Yet even that enemy of God
and man had friends and associates in
his desolation; I am quite alone.

â€œYou, who call Frankenstein your
friend, seem to have a knowledge of
my crimes and his misfortunes. But,
in the detail which he gave you of
them, he could not sum up the hours
and months of misery which I endured,
wasting in impotent passions. For
whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did not
satisfy my own desires. They were for
ever ardent and craving; still I desired
love and fellowship, and I was still
spurned. Was there no injustice in
this? Am I to be thought the only
criminal, when all human kind sinned
against me? Why do you not hate
Felix, who drove his friend from his
door with contumely? Why do you
not execrate the rustic who sought to
destroy the saviour of his child? Nay,
these are virtuous and immaculate beings!
I, the miserable and the abandoned,
am an abortion, to be spurned
