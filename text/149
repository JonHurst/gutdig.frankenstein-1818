pronunciation was quick; and the
words they uttered, not having any
apparent connexion with visible objects,
I was unable to discover any clue

several other words, without
being able as yet to understand or apply

to enter the cottage, their harsh manners
and rude gait only enhanced to me the

them, to cast off their melancholy. He
