at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even
now my blood boils at the recollection
of this injustice.

“But it is true that I am a wretch.
I have murdered the lovely and the
helpless; I have strangled the innocent
as they slept, and grasped to death
his throat who never injured me or
any other living thing. I have devoted
my creator, the select specimen of all
that is worthy of love and admiration
among men, to misery; I have pursued
him even to that irremediable ruin.
There he lies, white and cold in death.
You hate me; but your abhorrence
cannot equal that with which I regard
myself. I look on the hands which
executed the deed; I think on the
heart in which the imagination of it
was conceived, and long for the moment
when they will meet my eyes,
when it will haunt my thoughts, no
more.

“Fear not that I shall be the instrument
of future mischief. My work is
nearly complete. Neither your’s nor
any man’s death is needed to consummate
the series of my being, and accomplish
that which must be done;
but it requires my own. Do not think
that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.
I shall quit your vessel on the
ice-raft which brought me hither, and
shall seek the most northern extremity
of the globe; I shall collect my funeral
pile, and consume to ashes this miserable
frame, that its remains may
afford no light to any curious and unhallowed
wretch, who would create
such another as I have been. I shall
die. I shall no longer feel the agonies
