reverse of the picture. Continue to
write to me by every opportunity: I
may receive your letters (though the
chance is very doubtful) on some occasions
when I need them most to support
my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection, should
you never hear from me again.

Your affectionate brother,

ROBERT WALTON.
