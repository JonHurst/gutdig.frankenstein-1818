to question me further concerning the
cause of my dejection. He hoped that
new scenes, and the amusement of travelling,
would restore my tranquillity.

I now made arrangements for my
journey; but one feeling haunted me,
which filled me with fear and agitation.
During my absence I should leave my
friends unconscious of the existence of
their enemy, and unprotected from his
attacks, exasperated as he might be
by my departure. But he had promised
to follow me wherever I might go; and
would he not accompany me to England?
This imagination was dreadful
in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it
supposed the safety of my friends. I
was agonized with the idea of the possibility
that the reverse of this might
happen. But through the whole period
during which I was the slave of my
creature, I allowed myself to be governed
by the impulses of the moment;
and my present sensations strongly intimated
that the fiend would follow me,
and exempt my family from the danger
of his machinations.

It was in the latter end of August
that I departed, to pass two years of
exile. Elizabeth approved of the reasons
of my departure, and only regretted
that she had not the same opportunities
of enlarging her experience,
and cultivating her understanding. She
wept, however, as she bade me farewell,
and entreated me to return happy
and tranquil. “We all,” said she,
“depend upon you; and if you are
miserable, what must be our feelings?”
