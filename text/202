to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull
ugly siroc on its way to consume me.

Morning dawned before I arrived at
the village of Chamounix; but my presence,
so haggard and strange, hardly
calmed the fears of my family, who had
waited the whole night in anxious expectation
of my return.

The following day we returned to
Geneva. The intention of my father
in coming had been to divert my mind,
and to restore me to my lost tranquillity;
but the medicine had been fatal. And,
unable to account for the excess of
misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened
to return home, hoping the quiet and
monotony of a domestic life would by
degrees alleviate my sufferings from
whatsoever cause they might spring.

For myself, I was passive in all their
arrangements; and the gentle affection
of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate
to draw me from the depth of my
despair. The promise I had made to
the dæmon weighed upon my mind,
like Dante’s iron cowl on the heads of
the hellish hypocrites. All pleasures
of earth and sky passed before me like
a dream, and that thought only had to
me the reality of life. Can you wonder,
that sometimes a kind of insanity possessed
me, or that I saw continually
about me a multitude of filthy animals
inflicting on me incessant torture,
that often extorted screams and bitter
groans?

By degrees, however, these feelings
became calmed. I entered again into
the every-day scene of life, if not with
interest, at least with some degree of
tranquillity.
