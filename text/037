he attempts to demonstrate, and the
wonderful facts which he relates, soon
changed this feeling into enthusiasm.
A new light seemed to dawn upon my
mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated
my discovery to my father.
I cannot help remarking here the many
opportunities instructors possess of directing
the attention of their pupils to
useful knowledge, which they utterly
neglect. My father looked carelessly
at the title-page of my book, and said,
“Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear
Victor, do not waste your time upon
this; it is sad trash.”

If, instead of this remark, my father
had taken the pains, to explain to me,
that the principles of Agrippa had been
entirely exploded, and that a modern
system of science had been introduced,
which possessed much greater powers
than the ancient, because the powers
of the latter were chimerical, while
those of the former were real and practical;
under such circumstances, I
should certainly have thrown Agrippa
aside, and, with my imagination warmed
as it was, should probably have applied
myself to the more rational theory of
chemistry which has resulted from
modern discoveries. It is even possible,
that the train of my ideas would
never have received the fatal impulse
that led to my ruin. But the cursory
glance my father had taken of my volume
by no means assured me that he
was acquainted with its contents; and
I continued to read with the greatest

When I returned home, my first care
was to procure the whole works of this
