and if mine had been a sorrow to be
chased away by any fleeting circumstance,
this excursion would certainly
have had the effect intended by my father.
As it was, I was somewhat interested
in the scene; it sometimes lulled,
although it could not extinguish my
grief. During the first day we travelled
in a carriage. In the morning
we had seen the mountains at a distance,
towards which we gradually advanced.
We perceived that the valley
through which we wound, and which
was formed by the river Arve, whose
course we followed, closed in upon us
by degrees; and when the sun had set,
we beheld immense mountains and precipices
overhanging us on every side,
and heard the sound of the river raging
among rocks, and the dashing of water-falls
around.
