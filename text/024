This aroused the stranger’s attention;
and he asked a multitude of questions
concerning the route which the
dæmon, as he called him, had pursued.
Soon after, when he was alone with me,
he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your
curiosity, as well as that of these good
people; but you are too considerate to
make inquiries.”

“Certainly; it would indeed be very
impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of
mine.”

“And yet you rescued me from a
strange and perilous situation; you
have benevolently restored me to life.”

Soon after this he inquired, if I
thought that the breaking up of the ice
had destroyed the other sledge? I replied,
that I could not answer with any
degree of certainty; for the ice had
not broken until near midnight, and
the traveller might have arrived at a
place of safety before that time; but of
this I could not judge.

From this time the stranger seemed
very eager to be upon deck, to watch
for the sledge which had before appeared;
but I have persuaded him to remain
in the cabin, for he is far too weak to
sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
But I have promised that some one
should watch for him, and give him
instant notice if any new object should
appear in sight.

Such is my journal of what relates
to this strange occurrence up to the
present day. The stranger has gradually
improved in health, but is very
silent, and appears uneasy when any
one except myself enters his cabin.
