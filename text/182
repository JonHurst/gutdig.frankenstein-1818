for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness
sufficient to answer him, but
the effort destroyed all my remaining
strength; I sank on the chair, and
sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard
the steps of my younger protectors. I
had not a moment to lose; but, seizing
the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now
is the time! – save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends
whom I seek. Do not you desert me
in the hour of trial!’

“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old
man, ‘who are you?’

“At that instant the cottage door
was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha
entered. Who can describe their
horror and consternation on beholding
me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable
to attend to her friend, rushed out of
the cottage. Felix darted forward, and
with supernatural force tore me from
his father, to whose knees I clung: in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the
ground, and struck me violently with a
stick. I could have torn him limb from
limb, as the lion rends the antelope.
But my heart sunk within me as with
bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw
him on the point of repeating his blow,
when, overcome by pain and anguish,
I quitted the cottage, and in the general
tumult escaped unperceived to my
hovel.”
