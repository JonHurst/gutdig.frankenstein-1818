be enabled to conceal those feelings
that overpowered me. I knew that
they would remain that day at the inn;
and as I had ever inured myself to
rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to
go alone to the summit of Montanvert.
I remembered the effect that the view
of the tremendous and ever-moving
glacier had produced upon my mind
when I first saw it. It had then filled
me with a sublime ecstacy that gave
wings to the soul, and allowed it to
soar from the obscure world to light
and joy. The sight of the awful and
majestic in nature had indeed always
the effect of solemnizing my mind, and
causing me to forget the passing cares
of life. I determined to go alone, for I
was well acquainted with the path, and
the presence of another would destroy
the solitary grandeur of the scene.

The ascent is precipitous, but the
path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount
the perpendicularity of the
mountain. It is a scene terrifically
desolate. In a thousand spots the traces
of the winter avalanche may be perceived,
where trees lie broken and
strewed on the ground; some entirely
destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the
jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely
upon other trees. The path, as
you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually
roll from above; one of them
is particularly dangerous, as the slightest
sound, such as even speaking in a
loud voice, produces a concussion of
air sufficient to draw destruction upon
