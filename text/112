to admit of consolation, for there is no
hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest
Justine, with resignation, and a confidence
elevated beyond this world.
Oh! how I hate its shews and mockeries!
when one creature is murdered,
another is immediately deprived of life
in a slow torturing manner; then the
executioners, their hands yet reeking
with the blood of innocence, believe
that they have done a great deed. They
call this {{retribution}}. Hateful name!
When that word is pronounced, I know
greater and more horrid punishments
are going to be inflicted than the gloomiest
tyrant has ever invented to satiate
his utmost revenge. Yet this is not
consolation for you, my Justine, unless
indeed that you may glory in escaping
from so miserable a den. Alas! I
would I were in peace with my aunt
and my lovely William, escaped from a
world which is hateful to me, and the
visages of men which I abhor.”

Justine smiled languidly. “This,
dear lady, is despair, and not resignation.
I must not learn the lesson that
you would teach me. Talk of something
else, something that will bring
peace, and not increase of misery.”

During this conversation I had retired
to a corner of the prison-room, where
I could conceal the horrid anguish that
possessed me. Despair! Who dared
talk of that? The poor victim, who
on the morrow was to pass the dreary
boundary between life and death, felt
not as I did, such deep and bitter
agony. I gnashed my teeth, and
ground them together, uttering a groan
that came from my inmost soul.
