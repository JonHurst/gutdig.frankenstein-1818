pleasure, I was now alone. In the university,
whither I was going, I must form
my own friends, and be my own protector.
My life had hitherto been remarkably
secluded and domestic; and
this had given me invincible repugnance
to new countenances. I loved
my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval;
these were “old familiar faces;” but I
believed myself totally unfitted for the
company of strangers. Such were my
reflections as I commenced my journey;
but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes
rose. I ardently desired the acquisition
of knowledge. I had often, when
at home, thought it hard to remain
during my youth cooped up in one
place, and had longed to enter the
world, and take my station among other
human beings. Now my desires were
complied with, and it would, indeed,
have been folly to repent.
