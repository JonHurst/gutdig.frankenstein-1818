allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere
with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, Greece had not been enslaved;
Cæsar would have spared his
country; America would have been
discovered more gradually; and the
empires of Mexico and Peru had not
been destroyed.

But I forget that I am moralizing in
the most interesting part of my tale;
and your looks remind me to proceed.

My father made no reproach in his
letters; and only took notice of my
silence by inquiring into my occupations
more particularly than before.
Winter, spring, and summer, passed
away during my labours; but I did not
watch the blossom or the expanding
leaves – sights which before always
yielded me supreme delight, so deeply
was I engrossed in my occupation. The
leaves of that year had withered before
my work drew near to a close; and
now every day shewed me more plainly
how well I had succeeded. But my
enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety,
and I appeared rather like one doomed
by slavery to toil in the mines, or any
other unwholesome trade, than an artist
occupied by his favourite employment.
Every night I was oppressed by a slow
fever, and I became nervous to a most
painful degree; a disease that I regretted
the more because I had hitherto enjoyed
most excellent health, and had
always boasted of the firmness of my
nerves. But I believed that exercise
and amusement would soon drive away
such symptoms; and I promised myself
both of these, when my creation should
be complete.
