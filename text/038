author, and afterwards of Paracelsus
and Albertus Magnus. I read and
studied the wild fancies of these writers
with delight; they appeared to me treasures
known to few beside myself;
and although I often wished to communicate
these secret stores of knowledge
to my father, yet his indefinite
censure of my favourite Agrippa always
withheld me. I disclosed my discoveries
to Elizabeth, therefore, under a
promise of strict secrecy; but she did
not interest herself in the subject,
and I was left by her to pursue my
studies alone.

It may appear very strange, that a
disciple of Albertus Magnus should
arise in the eighteenth century; but
our family was not scientifical, and I
had not attended any of the lectures
given at the schools of Geneva. My
dreams were therefore undisturbed by
reality; and I entered with the greatest
diligence into the search of the philosopher’s
stone and the elixir of life.
