guiltless of this murder. I had no
fear, therefore, that any circumstantial
evidence could be brought forward
strong enough to convict her; and, in
this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting
the trial with eagerness, but without
prognosticating an evil result.

We were soon joined by Elizabeth.
Time had made great alterations in her
form since I had last beheld her. Six
years before she had been a pretty,
good-humoured girl, whom every one
loved and caressed. She was now a
woman in stature and expression of
countenance, which was uncommonly
lovely. An open and capacious forehead
gave indications of a good understanding,
joined to great frankness of
disposition. Her eyes were hazel, and
expressive of mildness, now through
recent affliction allied to sadness. Her
hair was of a rich, dark auburn, her
complexion fair, and her figure slight
and graceful. She welcomed me with
the greatest affection. “Your arrival,
my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me
with hope. You perhaps will find
some means to justify my poor guiltless
Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she
be convicted of crime? I rely on her
innocence as certainly as I do upon my
own. Our misfortune is doubly hard
to us; we have not only lost that lovely
darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I
sincerely love, is to be torn away by
even a worse fate. If she is condemned,
I never shall know joy more. But she
will not, I am sure she will not; and
then I shall be happy again, even after
the sad death of my little William.”

“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,”
