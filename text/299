mighty and terrific trial of your courage,
you shrink away, and are content
to be handed down as men who had
not strength enough to endure cold
and peril; and so, poor souls, they
were chilly, and returned to their warm
fire-sides. Why, that requires not this
preparation; ye need not have come
thus far, and dragged your captain to
the shame of a defeat, merely to prove
yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or
be more than men. Be steady to your
purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice
is not made of such stuff as your hearts
might be; it is mutable, cannot withstand
you, if you say that it shall not.
Do not return to your families with the
stigma of disgrace marked on your
brows. Return as heroes who have
fought and conquered, and who know
not what it is to turn their backs on
the foe.”

He spoke this with a voice so modulated
to the different feelings expressed
in his speech, with an eye so full of
lofty design and heroism, that can you
wonder that these men were moved.
They looked at one another, and were
unable to reply. I spoke; I told them
to retire, and consider of what had been
said: that I would not lead them
further north, if they strenuously desired
the contrary; but that I hoped
that, with reflection, their courage
would return.

They retired, and I turned towards
my friend; but he was sunk in languor,
and almost deprived of life.

How all this will terminate, I know
not; but I had rather die, than return
shamefully, – my purpose unfulfilled.
