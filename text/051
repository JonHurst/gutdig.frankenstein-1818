mentioning that in the beginning of
the following week he intended to commence
a course of lectures upon natural
philosophy in its general relations, and
that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor,
would lecture upon chemistry the alternate
days that he missed.

I returned home, not disappointed,
for I had long considered those authors
useless whom the professor had so
strongly reprobated; but I did not feel
much inclined to study the books which
I procured at his recommendation. M.
Krempe was a little squat man, with a
gruff voice and repulsive countenance;
the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess
me in favour of his doctrine. Besides,
I had a contempt for the uses of modern
natural philosophy. It was very different,
when the masters of the science
sought immortality and power; such
views, although futile, were grand: but
now the scene was changed. The ambition
of the inquirer seemed to limit
itself to the annihilation of those visions
on which my interest in science was
chiefly founded. I was required to
exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur
for realities of little worth.

Such were my reflections during the
first two or three days spent almost in
solitude. But as the ensuing week commenced,
I thought of the information
which M. Krempe had given me concerning
the lectures. And although I
could not consent to go and hear that
little conceited fellow deliver sentences
out of a pulpit, I recollected what he
had said of M. Waldman, whom I had
never seen, as he had hitherto been out
of town.
