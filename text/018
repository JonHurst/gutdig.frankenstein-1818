LETTER III.

{{To Mrs.}} SAVILLE, {{England}}.

July 7th, 17â€”.

MY DEAR SISTER,

I write a few lines in haste, to say
that I am safe, and well advanced on
my voyage. This letter will reach
England by a merchant-man now on
its homeward voyage from Archangel;
more fortunate than I, who may not see
my native land, perhaps, for many
years. I am, however, in good spirits:
my men are bold, and apparently firm
of purpose; nor do the floating sheets
of ice that continually pass us, indicating
the dangers of the region towards
which we are advancing, appear
to dismay them. We have already
reached a very high latitude; but it is
the height of summer, and although
not so warm as in England, the southern
gales, which blow us speedily towards
those shores which I so ardently
desire to attain, breathe a degree of
renovating warmth which I had not
expected.

No incidents have hitherto befallen
us, that would make a figure in a letter.
One or two stiff gales, and the breaking
of a mast, are accidents which experienced
navigators scarcely remember
to record; and I shall be well
