smoke of its passage. Mont Blânc,
the supreme and magnificent Mont
Blânc, raised itself from the surrounding
{{aiguilles}}, and its tremendous {{dome}}
overlooked the valley.

During this journey, I sometimes
joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to
point out to her the various beauties of
the scene. I often suffered my mule to
lag behind, and indulged in the misery
of reflection. At other times I spurred
on the animal before my companions,
that I might forget them, the world,
and, more than all, myself. When at
a distance, I alighted, and threw myself
on the grass, weighed down by
horror and despair. At eight in the
evening I arrived at Chamounix. My
father and Elizabeth were very much
fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied
us, was delighted, and in high spirits:
the only circumstance that detracted
from his pleasure was the south wind,
and the rain it seemed to promise for
the next day.

We retired early to our apartments,
but not to sleep; at least I did not.
I remained many hours at the window,
watching the pallid lightning that played
above Mont Blânc, and listening to
the rushing of the Arve, which ran
below my window.
